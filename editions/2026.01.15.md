### [Peter van Hardenberg - Ink and Switch, Automerge | devtools.fm (podcast episode)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2owS3nDHs)
"This week we're joined by Peter van Hardenberg (PVH), director of the Ink and Switch research lab and co-author of the seminal Local First Software paper. Peter shares the origin story of local-first software, from his realization on a San Francisco train to his work at Heroku and beyond. We dive deep into Automerge, Ink and Switch's local-first sync engine built on CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types), exploring how it enables real-time collaboration while keeping data on your computer. We discuss the technical challenges of building distributed systems, the philosophy behind local-first software, and how projects like Key Hive are pushing the boundaries of decentralized data access. Peter also shares his vision for the future of computing, where software ownership and interoperability become fundamental principles rather than afterthoughts."

### [I built my entire smart home without touching the cloud (video)](https://www.xda-developers.com/i-built-my-entire-smart-home-without-touching-the-cloud/)
"So, I decided to rebuild a smart home that works locally, without relying on any cloud services. That meant using devices with no mandatory accounts or servers necessary to turn on a device or run an automation. And the result was a system that’s been a game-changer, more responsive and predictable."

### [Use Local LLMs Already! (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfxgLX-MxMY)
"I'm sharing my experience using local GenAI for 1.5 years: for learning, research, coding, technical troubleshooting, generating images and more"

### [ChEffect - Part 13 (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mYF_LCDWYg)
"A Local-First App built with Effect & LiveStore By Maxwell Brown & Tim Smart"

### [It’s time to change your database | Theo - t3.gg (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6C-MWCFfAg)
"There's a reason everyone's moving from Firebase, Supabase, and all the other dbs, straight to Convex"

### [Vibe Coding Challenge: The Art and The Skill](https://toknow.ai/posts/vibe-coding-challenge/)
"The Architecture: Local-First Workflow Model: Blober isn’t just a CLI wrapper. It uses a persistent Workflow/Task model backed by a local SQLite DB:"

### [Teamtype on becoming independent of big corporations and their cloud servers](https://www.apc.org/en/news/teamtype-becoming-independent-big-corporations-and-their-cloud-servers)
"So we built in local-first support, using the Automerge library, which uses data structures called CRDTs (conflict-free replicated data type) to enable that kind of synchronisation with offline support."


## 🛠️ Tools & Resources

### [Basic likes feature with LiveStore](https://www.bohdanptyts.com/blog/basic-likes-feature-with-livestore)
"At its core, LiveStore combines event sourcing with a reactive SQLite database. User actions commit events that get stored in a local eventlog and immediately turned into queryable state in SQLite. The magic happens in sync: LiveStore pushes and pulls events between clients and a central sync backend, but the materialized data stays local - each client rebuilds its own SQLite state from the shared event history."

### [How to Build a Database without a Server](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/arcticdb-db-no-server/)
"Alex Seaton discusses the architecture of ArcticDB, a high-performance Python/C++ library that replaces traditional database servers with a thick-client model. He explains how to achieve atomicity on object storage through bottom-up writes and shares deep insights into conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs). He also explores the pitfalls of clock drift and distributed locking."

### [Fast Eventual Consistency: Inside Corrosion, the Distributed System Powering Fly.io](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/corrosion/)
"Somtochi Onyekwere explains the architecture of Corrosion, a distributed system designed for low-latency state replication. She shares how Fly.io transitioned from Consul to a gossip-based SQLite solution to handle global machine data. By discussing CRDTs, the SWIM protocol, and QUIC, she shares how to build resilient systems that prioritize speed while managing the complexities of CAP theorem."
