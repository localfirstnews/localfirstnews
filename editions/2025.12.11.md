### [Maybe we don't need a server](https://lecaro.me/20251203-maybe-we-do-not-need-a-server.html)
"Have you heard of syncthing ? It syncs a folder between devices, like Dropbox, without the need for someone else's computer. No cloud, it's just your pc talking to your phone, directly and automatically, through your home WiFi.[...] This got me thinking, how sensible could personal tech be, if it was truly serverless?"
