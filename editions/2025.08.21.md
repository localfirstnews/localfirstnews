### [Lessons learned from building a sync-engine and reactivity system with SQLite](https://www.finkelstein.fr/sqlite-sync-engine-with-reactivity)
"Over the last couple of months, I've been trying to build the dream: A local-first, end-to-end encrypted and reactive app, with all of the user's data in a local SQL database but continually synced to a remote server. This article summarizes my learning and how I ended up building a minimal sync engine for SQLite with full reactivity." See also [HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44929478)

### [Local Cloud Emulation](https://iamdan.me/local-cloud/)
"Adopting a local first approach not only improves DX, but also engenders a more flexible, cloud-agnostic system. This can be achieved by building in-memory versions of platform services. While daunting at first, it ends up being much simpler than expected."

### [OrbitDB: Peer-to-Peer Databases for the Decentralized Web](https://orbitdb.org/)
"OrbitDB is a serverless, distributed, peer-to-peer database. OrbitDB uses IPFS as its data storage and IPFS Pubsub to automatically sync databases with peers. It‚Äôs an eventually consistent database that uses CRDTs for conflict-free database merges making OrbitDB an excellent choice for decentralized apps (dApps), blockchain applications and offline-first web applications."

### [Synchrotron](https://github.com/evelant/synchrotron)
"An opinionated yet flexible approach to offline-first data sync with PGlite, Electric SQL, and Effect."
