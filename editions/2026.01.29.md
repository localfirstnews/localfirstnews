Turso recently spurred discussion on Hacker News

### [It’s incredible. It’s terrifying. It’s MoltBot.](https://1password.com/blog/its-moltbot)
"MoltBot (formerly Clawd Bot), the locally running, open-source AI agent named after the Lobster workflow shell that powers its agentic loop, has rocked an AI community that, just weeks ago, was so in love with its own hype it would have yawned at literal magic."


## 🛠️ Tools & Resources

### [Fireside: Building Replicate 2.0](https://www.notion.so/Fireside-Building-Replicate-2-0-2f526eeb0e7e81cf84dee561850e8f44)
"Segment on the architecture and lessons learned building a local-first sync engine for Convex"

### [LiquidOS & AutoAgents](https://liquidos.ai/)
"AutoAgents is our open-source Rust SDK for building reliable agent systems today. LiquidOS Platform is coming soon as an agentic operating system: local-first for embedded systems, robotics, and local agent execution, with tracing, policy controls, evals, and deployment workflows." Also see [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ggq-NjIvbHo)

### [Consistency Cabaret](https://github.com/resonatehq-examples/example-tigerbeetle-account-creation-ts)
"This example shows how to keep two systems in sync without transactions using 'write last, read first.' TigerBeetle is the system of record, SQLite is reference."


## ✨ Apps 

### [bitchat](https://github.com/permissionlesstech/bitchat)
"A decentralized peer-to-peer messaging app with dual transport architecture: local Bluetooth mesh networks for offline communication and internet-based Nostr protocol for global reach. No accounts, no phone numbers, no central servers. It's the side-groupchat."

### [Footnote](https://footnote.wiki/)
"Footnote keeps your notes on your devices and syncs directly with people you trust. No cloud, no vendor lock-in."

### [Cfait: Powerful, fast and elegant CalDAV task manager](https://flathub.org/en/apps/com.trougnouf.Cfait)
"Cfait is designed for speed and stability using Rust. It puts you in control of your data with a local-first approach that syncs seamlessly across your devices via CalDAV."

### [ChatVault](https://github.com/marcoshernanz/ChatVault)
"ChatVault is a local-first semantic search engine for WhatsApp exports. It uses Rust and WebAssembly to run a BERT neural network directly in your browser."

### [Flint](https://www.disnetdev.com/blog/2026-01-03-new-year-new-flint/)
"Under the hood, the way Flint stores data has also changed. Previously we used a local SQLite database with a two-way sync to markdown files. This worked well enough (though the sync code was gross and had unresolved bugs) but the architecture made it hard to implement features I really wanted like versioning and syncing. So, the new Flint now uses Automerge to store notes, while still keeping the two-way markdown file syncing of the previous version."

### [caricature.life](https://caricature.life/)
"caricature.life started from a simple frustration. Every time I wanted a clean, minimalist caricature, I hit gated websites asking for logins, emails, and unclear privacy trade-offs. I built caricature.life to be the opposite. 🔐 No logins or signups 👀 No tracking or stored photos ✨ No watermarks"
