DeltaDB uses CRDTs to incrementally record and synchronize changes as they happen."

"It uses a trusted local LLM (via Ollama, llama.cpp, etc.) to intercept your prompt before it goes to a cloud service like OpenAI. It finds sensitive data and replaces it with semantic placeholders. Only the anonymized prompt is sent to the cloud. When the response returns, PromptMask uses the map to restore your original data, so that your secrets never leave your machine."
