### [“The local-first rebellion”: How Home Assistant became the most important project in your house](https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/the-local-first-rebellion-how-home-assistant-became-the-most-important-project-in-your-house/)
"Home Assistant is now running in more than 2 million households, orchestrating everything from thermostats and door locks to motion sensors and lighting. All on users’ own hardware, not the cloud. The contributor base behind that growth is just as remarkable: 21,000 contributors in a single year, feeding into one of GitHub’s most lively ecosystems at a time when a new developer joins GitHub every second."

### [Ink & Switch Dispatch 014](https://www.inkandswitch.com/newsletter/dispatch-014/)
"We’ve accelerated our work on Keyhive, a capabilities-based auth system specially designed for local-first software, to prepare it for GAIOS. Adding access control is an important step for collaborative systems like GAIOS and Patchwork: it defines who can connect, who can request documents, and lays the groundwork for richer permissions in the future."

It's built to make it easy to focus on distributed application logic, instead of the usual shuttling of state between peers, clients, agents, etc. in a distributed system."
