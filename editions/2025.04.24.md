### [Lab note #068 Dealing with collections incrementally](https://interjectedfuture.com/lab-note-068-dealing-with-collections-incrementally/)

### [Exploring the AT Protocol as a distribution layer for local-first software](https://whtwnd.com/grjte.sh/3lndb5weupc2r)

They share core ideals about user ownership and control, but they also offer different benefits as a result of their different approaches and goals. I was curious if combining them in a lightweight way would enable us to leverage some of the distinct benefits of each approach within the other context."
