"8 more days to submit your proposal to the Local-First devroom at the upcoming [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2026/) (biggest Free and Open Source conference in Europe)! Deadline is **5th of December**. If you are into local first apps or frameworks and want to show your work, sync protocol, CRDT library, now is the moment to apply. You will be part of a great lineup with all leading actors in the field, gathering in Brussels on the 31 of January afternoon. Share the [link to the CfP](https://openlocalfirst.org)!"

### [LoFi/32 Community Meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVuXngrG4Es&list=PLTbD2QA-VMnXFsLbuPGz1H-Najv9MD2-H&index=32)
The LoFi/32 community meetup took place on Tuesday November 25th, with talks by Paolo Scanferla ("Build yourself a local-first app in 2 minutes"), Bryan Watts ("Dream: Composable systems thgrough story"), and Tyrkjo Turskiy ("Collaborative video software and sync engines").

### [LLM APIs are a Synchronization Problem](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/11/22/llm-apis/#ai)
"There’s a whole ecosystem that has dealt with this kind of mess before: the local-first movement. Those folks spent a decade figuring out how to synchronize distributed state across clients and servers that don’t trust each other, drop offline, fork, merge, and heal."

### [Composing capability security and conflict-free replicated data types](https://spritely.institute/news/composing-capability-security-and-conflict-free-replicated-data-types.html)
"In August, I attended the DWeb Seminar where a small group of builders gathered to discuss the state-of-the-art and open problems in the distributed web space. Some in the group are primarily concerned with distributed data and focus on sync algorithms and local-first use cases. I am mainly concerned with distributed behavior and focus on the object capability security model. Both areas of study are steeped in their own lore and research papers, which makes it difficult for the two camps to communicate effectively with each other. It is in the interest of unity that I write this blog post."


## 🛠️ Tools & Resources

### [The Local-First Comeback You Didn’t See Coming](https://shivekkhurana.com/blog/sync-engines/)
"Use sync engines when you have high read density (users navigate frequently, need instant access to data) and power user UX requirements (keyboard navigation, offline capability, zero loading states). Examples: Linear, Superhuman, Figma."

### [The Missing Abstraction for AI Agents: The Agent Filesystem | Turso](https://turso.tech/blog/agentfs)
"A SQLite database, itself being just a file, is perfect for capturing agent state. But after talking agent developers, we found that people preferred to consume SQLite at a higher level of abstraction. That's why we've built AgentFS SDK, an agent filesystem abstraction."

### [CloudKit Sync: Finesse (Point-Free)](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep346-cloudkit-sync-finesse)
"We round out are synchronization series with a grab bag finale. We’ll explore explicit synchronization, custom logout behavior, how the library handles read-only permissions, and how you can incorporate theses permissions in your app’s behavior."


## ✨ Apps 

### [LocalSend](https://github.com/localsend/localsend)
"LocalSend is a free, open-source app that allows you to securely share files and messages with nearby devices over your local network without needing an internet connection."

### [Miden](https://miden.xyz/)
"Miden brings practical privacy to web3, combining high throughput, private transactions and verifiable computation. It’s designed to power the next generation of financial applications that demand both privacy and compliance."

### [Mindwire Stream](https://mindwire.io/)
"A private, free, lightning-fast RSS reader built for Android."

### [Show HN: I built a local fuzzing tool to red-team LLM agents (Python, SQLite)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46046683)
"I spent the last week building a local-first security tool because I was tired of paying $500/mo for enterprise SaaS just to test my AI agents for basic vulnerabilities."
