## 🛠️ Tools & Resources

### [Will Turso Be The Better SQLite? (with Glauber Costa) | Developer Voices (interview video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JHOY0zqNBY)
"Glauber Costa spent a decade contributing to the Linux kernel at Red Hat, then helped build Scylla, a high-performance rewrite of Cassandra. Now he's applying those lessons to SQLite. After initially forking SQLite (which produced a working business but failed to attract contributors), his team is taking the bolder path: a complete rewrite in Rust called Turso. The project already has features SQLite lacks - vector search, CDC, browser-native async operation - and is using deterministic simulation testing (inspired by TigerBeetle) to match SQLite's legendary reliability without access to its test suite." See also [Lobsters discussion](https://lobste.rs/s/l2icfd/will_turso_be_better_sqlite).
